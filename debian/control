Description: Test program printing 'Hello World!' to STDOUT
 Test program printing 'Hello World!' to STDOUT, that actually 
 turned into an attempt to make a helper for building/installing 
 on different (*nix primarily) OSes via SCons "out-of-the-box" 
 (that is without (distro's) maintainer patches).
